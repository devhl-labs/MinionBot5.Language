# Minion Bot Languages
This repository is where the Minion Bot responses are stored. 
You don't have to be a programmer to add a new language. 
Simply copy the files you want to edit here and paste into a simple text editor like Notepad (please do not use Word).
Translate the bot's reponses, and then pass that to me over Discord. 
If you are a programmer, feel free to submit a pull request.
You don't have to translate everything. If no translation is provided, we can just default to English.
